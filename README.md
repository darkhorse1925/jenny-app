For better experience use desktop/laptop, since the css was not made responsive for **mobile devices**. If u are to use in mobile atleast switch desktop view on browser.

Check the working site at [jennysaquarium.netlify.app](https://jennysaquarium.netlify.app)

**This website is solely made for demonstrative purpose and fun.**

There is some netlify bug that shows 404 error will try to fix it in future
