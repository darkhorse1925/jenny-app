Check the working site at [jennysaquarium.netlify.app](https://jennysaquarium.netlify.app)

**This website is solely made for demonstrative purpose and fun.**

For better experience use desktop/laptop, since the css was not made responsive for **mobile devices**. If u are to use in mobile atleast switch desktop view on browser.

There is a more detailed **README/About** page inside the website, click that for more info.

The front end react app is hoasted at netlify.

And the back end api is hoasted at heroku.

Going straight to so page other than / seems throws a 404 error from netlify, this is as far as I know is some netlify error, will try to fix it future.
